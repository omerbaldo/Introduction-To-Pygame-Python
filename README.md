# Introduction-To-Pygame-Python
-This repository is a brief introduction for a library in Python called Pygame. 
During the summer of 2016, I worked for ID Tech Camps and taught students how to make python games. The information I created(handouts, sample programs, notes) will be posted within this repo. 

To run projects download a version later than python 3. Code was written in python 3.2
